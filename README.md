# MOC player patched to use pulseaudio and to start always in playlist
## Why
I like [MOC](https://moc.daper.net/) but I don't need its built-in file manager since I add music via file manager so I created a patch that automatically switches MOC to a playlist view which saves me a key press. 
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex-ryzhkov/moc-pkgbuild.git
cd moc-pkgbuild
makepkg -sci
```
